# Hierarchical Modeling Demo with Animated Plots

## Description

This project was originally intended to be used as an educational tool to demonstrate two key concepts:

- Effects of nested hierarchical structures
- Fundamentals of hierarchical modeling, including a comparison of a pooled model, unpooled models, and a hierarchical model (with partial pooling)
 
While performing my analyses, I found that only one level of grouping present in the data actually accounted for any non-negligible variance in the response. As a result, my tool discusses the concept of nested hierarchical structures but only examines one grouping level in great detail.
Secondly, some of the model results presented in the analysis ended up being a bit counterintuitive, providing an opportunity to discuss what may have led to the results, perform model diagnostics, and test out how the results would be impacted by a change in sample size.

The concepts mentioned above are illustrated through the analysis of a
dataset containing information about 20 Major League Baseball (MLB) seasons. It is my hope that the main analysis output (animated plots to show the difference between hierachical models vs. unpooled linear regression models) will help to capture the interest of and provide relevant information to those who may be unfamiliar with hierarchical modeling.
